# SMARTbot x Metaphor x OpenAI

## Overview

So, for this project, I have developed a chatbot that will assist users in finding real estate listings tailored to their preferences. This Real Estate Advisor chatbot, built using Python, harnesses the power of OpenAI and the Metaphor API. Additionally, it employs OpenAI to provide summarized descriptions of each listing, making it easier for users to evaluate their options. This project simplifies the process of finding real estate, enhancing the user experience in the property search journey.

## How I built it?

Initialization: I started by initializing the necessary APIs. OpenAI was used for text summarization, and the Metaphor API was employed for real estate listing searches.

User Preferences: The chatbot prompts users to input their location, price range, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms they desire.

Search Listings: Using the user's preferences, the chatbot constructs a query and performs a search for real estate listings using the Metaphor API.

Display Results: The chatbot presents the user with a curated list of properties, including details like location, price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and descriptions.

Text Summarization: To enhance user experience, OpenAI is used to summarize the property descriptions, making it easier for users to evaluate their options.

## Challenges

Authentication: One challenge encountered was related to API key management, ensuring that the keys were correctly set up in the code and environment variables.

Search Queries: Crafting effective search queries for the Metaphor API to retrieve accurate real estate listings was a challenge. Refining queries and adapting them to user preferences required experimentation.

## Interest In Metaphor
First of all, I had a blast working with this project and Metaphor API. I Believe that Metaphor's capabilities to retrieve and summarize web content are incredibly valuable. It allows developers to create intelligent applications that can process and present information to users in a more accessible and digestible format. The ability to extract structured data from web pages and summarize it with ease opens up various possibilities for enhancing user experiences across different domains, including real estate, news, and more. Metaphor's versatility aligns well with my interest in building AI-powered solutions that simplify complex tasks for users.
